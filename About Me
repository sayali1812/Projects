Growing up in a rural district of India, I witnessed firsthand the profound impact that education can have on individuals and their communities. However, I also observed the stark disparities in access to quality education, which often perpetuated cycles of inequality. This early exposure to educational inequities ignited a passion within me to work towards bridging these gaps and leveraging education as a means of empowerment and social change.
My academic journey has been guided by a relentless commitment to addressing these disparities. I pursued my undergraduate studies in computer engineering, recognizing the transformative potential of technology in improving educational access and outcomes. Throughout my undergraduate years, I delved into the world of data science and machine learning, captivated by their capacity to unravel complex real-world problems.
My professional experiences have further reinforced my dedication to the intersection of education and technology.

This role offered me invaluable insights into the pivotal role that data-driven approaches can play in transforming the education sector, from personalized learning experiences to data-informed policy decisions.
While my academic and professional journey has been rewarding, I believe that there is much more to learn and discover in the field of data and analytics. I am particularly excited about the opportunity to work with a dynamic team, contributing my skills and passion for analytics to drive business, marketing, and data-driven decision-making.
In terms of my analytical skills, I have a proven track record of leveraging data to derive actionable insights. My experience at Dentsu involved using statistical analysis and data mining techniques to optimize business strategies, resulting in tangible outcomes. I have honed my skills in data visualization tools, including Tableau and Power BI, to present complex data in a clear and compelling manner, aiding decision-makers in the strategic planning process.
Moreover, my background in computer engineering and exposure to machine learning equips me with a solid foundation for tackling complex business challenges. I am proficient in SQL, Python, and data analytics tools, ensuring a comprehensive approach to extracting meaningful insights from diverse datasets.
